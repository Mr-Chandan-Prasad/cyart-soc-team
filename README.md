CYART SOC Team – Week 2: Alert Management & Evidence Preservation

Week 2 focuses on real-world SOC operations including alert triage, incident response, and forensic evidence preservation.
All data in this repository is collected from live systems, not templates or simulations.

📌 Learning Outcomes

By the end of Week 2, the analyst completes:

Alert triage using SIEM (Wazuh)

IOC validation using threat intelligence

Forensic evidence collection with Velociraptor

Hashing & integrity verification (SHA256)

Chain of custody documentation

End-to-end incident response

Technical and stakeholder reporting

This repository demonstrates practical SOC analyst skills using industry-standard tools and methods.

🧪 Week 2 Tasks (Summary)
Alert Management

Classify alerts, assign priority, and map techniques to MITRE ATT&CK.

Response Documentation

Create incident response templates and documentation used during investigations.

Alert Triage

Analyze alerts, validate IOCs with VirusTotal/OTX, and distinguish true vs. false positives.

Evidence Preservation

Collect volatile data (netstat, processes, system info), calculate hashes, and maintain a complete chain of custody.

Capstone Project

A full incident lifecycle:

Attack (Metasploit vsftpd exploit)

Detection (Wazuh)

Response (CrowdSec)

Investigation & reporting

🔍 Evidence Summary (Collected 2025-11-21)

Real forensic evidence gathered from a Windows host:

netstat_20251121.txt

network_connections.csv

process_list.csv

systeminfo.txt

Corresponding *.sha256 integrity hashes

All evidence is preserved using Velociraptor, documented in chain_of_custody.md.
